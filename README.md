- Material UI

## Goals for this project

The main goal of this project is to gain experience developing a full-stack app. I also put a little extra emphasis on exploring new technologies and see how well and how fast I would be able to adapt to something new while also consolidating the knowledge of the technologies learned during the academy. For that purpose, I decided to use typescript in the front-end while keeping it simple in the back-end with technologies I was already familiar with. I used a Material UI for the UI design which was also new to me. In short:

- Practice full-stack development;
- Learn new technologies
- Implement a developer's approach by creating and following User stories and wireframes.

## User Stories and Wireframe

- [Kanban with user stories](https://github.com/users/saraghaedi/projects/1)
- [UML](https://dbdiagram.io/d/61601331940c4c4eec8baab0)
- [Wire frame] (https://wireframepro.mockflow.com/space/event-management)

## Git workflow

To be continued...

## Server-repository

The back-end was built in express and it is a REST a API. The database is built using Postgres and Sequelize. You can find the back-end's repository [HERE](https://github.com/saraghaedi/event-management-backend)
